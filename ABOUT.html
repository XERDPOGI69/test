        <li><h1>About me</h1></li>
        <p>Hello, everyone! I'm Joshua Portacion, a friendly student developer and technology enthusiast. 
            I thoroughly enjoy working on projects and sharing my discoveries with others. I'm absolutely 
            delighted to have you visit my personal website. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey to earn 
            my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at Olivarez College. Whether you're 
            here to chat, learn, or share your tech experiences, I'm thrilled to have you along for the ride. 
            Thanks for stopping by!</p>
        
        <li><h1>Education</h1></li>
        <p>I'm a hardworking student at Olivarez College, and I'm on a mission to earn my BSIT degree. 
            I believe that education is like a strong foundation upon which I'm constructing my future. 
            I'm enthusiastic about the knowledge and skills I'm acquiring, and I can't wait to use them 
            to make a difference in the world of technology. It's an exciting journey of learning and growth!</p>

        <li><h1>Interest and Hobbies</h1></li>
        <p>When I'm not busy with school, I have a variety of things that I find fascinating. 
            Technology is a big passion of mine. I'm always curious about the newest gadgets 
            and what makes them work. I'm also quite the enthusiast when it comes to programming. 
            It's a bit like solving puzzles, and I get to be creative in the process.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to my love for tech, I'm drawn to the world of art. Specifically, I have 
            a soft spot for graphic design and user interface (UI) design. There's something magical 
            about transforming ideas into visuals that are both attractive and user-friendly. It's like
            painting a digital canvas.
            <br>
            <br>
            And then there's sports. I enjoy staying active and engaged in physical activities. It's a great way 
            to keep fit, unwind, and balance the tech and creative parts of my life. So, whether I'm exploring the 
            latest in tech, coding away, getting artsy on the screen, or running around on the field, each of these 
            interests makes me who I am.
        </p>   
        
        <li><h1>Skills</h1></li>
        <p>My journey in the field of information technology has equipped me with a variety of skills. I have experience 
            in programming languages like Java, HTML, and CSS, along with Python, and I'm in the process of learning JavaScript. 
            In addition to my programming skills, I also have a talent for User Interface and graphics design. I enjoy creating 
            visually appealing and user-friendly designs.</p>

        <li><h1>Projects</h1></li>
        <p>As a student, I've had the chance to get hands-on with some exciting projects that have helped me better understand 
            how technology works in the real world. One project I tackled was creating a Point of Sale system, which is kind of 
            like the computer you see at the cash register in stores. This project helped me learn about how businesses handle 
            sales and transactions efficiently.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also took on the task of designing a Clinic Information System. It's a bit like a digital filing cabinet for healthcare, 
            where I got to learn about managing patient records and appointments. I love games, and I couldn't resist trying my hand at 
            game development. I built both a Text Twist game and a Hangman game using Java. It was really fun to see how coding can turn 
            into something so enjoyable and interactive.
            <br>
            <br>
            And, when it comes to web stuff, I tried my hand at web development too. I created a Calculator and a To-Do List
            using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are everyday tools that I made a little more functional and user-friendly. These projects 
            have been like my personal adventure into the world of technology, and they show how much I enjoy learning and using what I've learned
            in practical ways as a student.
